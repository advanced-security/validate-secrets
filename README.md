# Validate Secrets

This Python module checks a list of secrets for validity and returns the results as a CSV file.

It can optionally notify the secret user if it is still valid, for some secrets.

It will return 'valid', 'invalid' or 'error' for each secret.

For secrets that don't have an "activity" state (e.g. identity numbers), they will either be 'valid' or 'error' for those that are not real secrets.

> [!WARNING]
> Validation in some cases requires connecting to a cloud service to try the credential. You need to check the legal implications of this for yourself before using this tool. This is not legal advice.

> [!CAUTION]
> âš Notification will require connecting to a cloud service to use the credential and create some form of message. You need to check the legal implications of this for yourself before using this tool. This is not legal advice.
